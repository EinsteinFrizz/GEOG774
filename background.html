<h2>Background</h2>
<h3>Shore Platforms</h3>
<p>Shore platforms are a landform found on rocky coasts. They are created by the erosion of cliffs through wave action and subaerial processes. These flat outcrops of rock are intertidal, meaning they are located between the water level of high and low tide.<br>
Shore platforms are categorised into two main types based on their gradient &mdash; sloping (1&deg;&nbsp;-&nbsp;5&deg;) and sub-horizontal (&lt;&nbsp;1&deg;).</p>
<h3>Waves</h3>
<p>Water waves behave in several ways when they encounter obstacles, including the sea floor.<br>
These include:
<div style="margin-left: 2em"><ul>
	<li><b>Reflection</b><br>Waves bounce off a barrier, changing their direction.</li>
	<li><b>Refraction</b><br>Waves change speed as they enter areas of different water depth, generally causing a bend in wave direction.</li>
	<li><b>Diffraction</b><br>Waves change direction to warp around barriers or openings.</li>
	<li><b>Shoaling</b><br>Wave height increases due to interaction with the sea floor. Wave direction is unchanged.</li>
</ul></div>
</p>
<p>An important type of wave to consider when investigating shore platforms is <b>infragravity waves</b>. Infragravity waves are group-bound long waves, with a large wavelength and small amplitude. Their frequency is typically cited as 0.005&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;Hz, while gravity waves ('normal' water waves) have a frequency of 0.05&nbsp;-1&nbsp;Hz.<br><br>
Infragravity waves are prevalent on shore platforms due to the mechanism of their creation. Infragravity waves form as a 'secondary' wave within a group of waves, where two wave trains interact through superposition. As waves break, the infragravity wave within them is released. This is often not very noticeable on beaches, but the flat nature of shore platforms allows infragravity waves to travel far. This has impacts on the importance of infragravity waves in sediment transport.</p>
